# E_commerceBE

##Lessons learned: This assignment had me confused for a bit when it came to the route associations, I really struggled to understand how that works and how to correctly include which model assoctiated with which other model through a different model.Other than that it went fairly well. I had a great moment when I managed to debugged a few issues on my own as well as noticing a difference in how I was able to read the code now and understand for the most part what was being written.

##Description

challeneg was to create a data base using sequelize and link all the tables together in order to use api routes to get, post, update, create and delete items from the tables.
